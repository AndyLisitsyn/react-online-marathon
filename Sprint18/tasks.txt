The tasks of the topic "custom hooks"
There are components EntitiesList and EntityDetails in the application. These components have similar logic: they both display some external data that is loaded via a method passed in a props.

Please, extract common logic regarding fetching data into custom hook.

Name it "useLoading" and place into the "hooks" folder. Use named export for the hook.
The hook should have one argument - method that fetches data.
The hook should return retrieved data.

Update EntitiesList and EntityDetails to use the hook.

1. for error in render jsx
We have DataItem component that can have exception thrown on rendering.


Please, create DataList component. This component shoud render Dataitem 3 times. Each time it should be wrapped in error boundary, so that if exception will be thrown, error boundary will provide fallback ui.
Fallback ui should be provided by ErrorFallback component. It should display message of thrown error and give an ability to retry creating DataItem component by clicking on 'Try again' button


2*. for error in click handler
Also, we have DataReceiver component, that can retrieve data on a button click, and sometimes exception can happen inside of this click handler. Fallback ui should be the same as in previous subtask:


general application behavior


Note: use React Error Boundary for the solution
