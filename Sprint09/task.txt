Please, implement adding and deleting of communication channels

Information about count of added channels and the type of the last added channel should be displayed in the right side of the screen by the ChannelStatistics component. 
Type of the last added channel should be displayed only if it is selected.

Make updates to the components so that rerendering will be executed only for those ContactItem components that are actually modified and need rerendering
